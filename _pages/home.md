### Welcome!

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next-generation genome editing and therapy represents advanced strategies to precisely (epi)genetic modification for treating diseases. Building on the CRISPR-Cas system, it integrates novel tools like base editors, prime editors, epigenetic editors, and AI-discovered nucleases, enabling safe, specific, and programmable therapeutics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major innovation behind these advancements, particularly through the use of Protein Language Models (PLMs). These models are instrumental in identifying, engineering, and generating novel genome editors, which in turn boost the precision, efficiency, and scalability of genetic research and medical applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The applications of these technologies are vast, targeting monogenic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases through mechanisms such as correcting mutations, inserting therapeutic genes, and silencing harmful alleles. Furthermore, synthetic biotechnology, enabled by genome editing, is expanding the scope of cell therapy to new frontier beyond blood cancer, such as autoimmune diseases, rejuvenation, and pathogenic fibrosis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
AI-enabled genome editing holds promise to treat previously incurable or untargetable diseases, like eradicating hereditary conditions, reprogramming the immune system to fight disease, and even improving agricultural and climatic practices. The combined evolution of AI and cell-specific delivery technologies will enable a powerful synergy with genome editing, unlocking unprecedented opportunities for medical and therapeutic innovation, thus improving human health.

### About me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a principal investigator working in the field of genome editing, cell and gene therapy. I received my PhD degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. After completing my doctoral studies, I worked as an assistant investigator at the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Visual Science, Wenzhou Medical University for two years; then as a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet for three years, where my research achievements were spun off in Hong Kong and a Biotech (GenEditBio) was launched in 2021. Now, I have been relocated to the China Pharmaceutical University since Aug 2025.
